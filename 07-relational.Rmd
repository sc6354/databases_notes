a. `LOSSY DECOMPOSITION` - a bad decompositon 

b. `LOSELESS DECOMPOSITION`- no loss of info. by replacing a relation R w/2 relations R~1~ & R~2~
      - for a lossy decomposition, we would get a superset of the original relation

c. `NORMILIZATION` - goal is to generate a set of tables that allow us to store info. w/o unnecessary redunancy, & yet allows us to retrieve info. easily 
      - General steps:
          
          1. Decide if a table is in "GOOD FORM"
          2. If NOT, decompose it into a num. of smaller relational schemas in a normal form 
          
      
      
## Decomposition using Functional Dependencies 
a. `LEGAL INSTANCE` - of a relation is one that satifies all real-world constraints

        Ex. students & instructors at a university must have an unqiue ID
