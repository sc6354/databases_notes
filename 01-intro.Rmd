# Introduction {#intro}

## Overview {-}
a. `DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS)` - collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data 
      - goal is to store and retrieve database info. conveniently and efficiently 
      
      
b. `DATABASE` - the collection of data that contains info. relevant to the enterprise 

## Database System Applications 
a. DSMS are used to manage collections of data that are:
      - highly valuable 
      - relatively large and 
      - accessed by multiple users and applications at once 
      
b. DBMs uses ABSTRACTION to manage the COMPLEXITY of a data collection
      - abstraction allows an user to use a complex device/system w/o having to know the details of how the system/device is constructed 

:::note
`Some Example Applications`

1. human resources - info. about employees, salaries, payroll taxes, benefits and for generation of paychecks
2. Credit Card Transactions
3. Airlines were among the first to use databases in a geographically distributed manner for reservations and schedule info. 
4. Web-based services such as social media, online retailers, online advertisements 
5. Document-based for maintaining articles, patents, publications
6. Navigation systems

## Purpose of Database System 
a. `FILE PROCESSING SYSTEM`- is supported by a conventional operation system; stores permanent records in various files and needs different applications programs to extract records from, and add records to the appropriate files 

b. Many disadvantages of a file processing system:
      - DATA REDUNDANCY AND INCONSISTENCY- due to different files with different structures and written in different languages by programmers over time 
      - DIFFICULTLY ACCESSING DATA -  b/c conventional file-processing do _NOT_ allow data to be retrieved in an efficient manner 
      - DATA ISOLATION - must write a new application program to retrieve data scattered in various formatted files
      - INTEGRITY PROBLEMS - not being able to satisfy consistency constraints
      
            Ex. not being able to the program to enforce new constraints
      - ATOMICITY PROBLEMS - changes must be atomic (it must happen in its entirety or not at all)
      
             Ex. a bank transfer from account A to B. A credit and a debit must occur, not just one 
           
      - CONCURRENT-ACCESS ANOMALITIES - when 2 user change the data and both changes are updated leading to 2 different results and supervision is _DIFFICULT_
      
:::note
These difficulties prompted the transitions from file-based apps. to database systems in the 1960s and 1970s

## View of Data 
a. major purpose of a database is to provide and _ABSTRACT_ view of data while hiding the details of how data are stored and maintained 

b. `DATA MODELS` - the underlying structure of a database; a collection of conceptual tools, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints 
      - all data can be classified into 4 categories: `RELATIONAL MODELS`, `ENTITY RELATIONAL MODEL`, `SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA MODEL`, `OBJECT-BASED MODEL`
      
$$\\[.1cm]$$
      
c. `RELATIONAL MODEL`- uses a colletion of tables to represent both the data and the relationships among those data 

:::note 
Tables are also called relations and each table has multiple columns with unique names 
:::

d. `ENTITY-RELATIONAL (ER) MODEL` - uses a collection of basic objects called _ENTITIES_ and _RELATIONSHIPS_ among those objects 

e. `SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA MODEL` - permits specification of data where individual data items of the same type may have different attributes 
      -  data items in the models above must have the same set of attributes 
      - most widely used semi-structured data representations are JSON and extensible markup language (XML)
      
$$\\[.1cm]$$
      
f.  `OBJECT-BASED DATA MODELS` - extends the relational model w/notions of encapsulation, methods, and object identity

g. `DATA ABSTRACTION`- hiding the complexity of the system from users to simplify their interaction w/the system
      - 3 levels of abstractions:
      ![Levels of Abstraction](/images/ch1/levels_of_abstraction.jpg)
      - `VIEW LEVEL`- the highgest level of abstraction that only describes the part of the database; exist to simplify interaction w/the system and the system may provide multiple views for the same database
      - `LOGICAL LEVEL` -  describes the entire databse in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures
      - `PHYSICAL LEVEL` - the lowest level of abstration that describes how the data is stored in detail 

:::note                  
Users at the logical level does not need to be aware of the complex physical structure involved (a.k.a physical data independence). Database adminstratorswho decide on what info. to keep uses this level 
:::
      
h. `SCHEMA` - the overall design of the database
      - physical schema -> the design at the physical level 
      - logical schema -> the design at the logical level 
      - subschema -> the design at the view level 
      
:::note 
* logical schema most important b/c programmers use this schema to construct applications

* applications exhibit `PHYSICAL DATA INDEPENDENCE` if they do not depend on the physical schema

## Database Languages 
a. a DBMS provides a _data-definition language (DDL)_ to specify the database schema and a _data-manipulation language (DML)_ to express database queries and update
      - in practice DDL and DML are parts of a single database language such as SQL and almost all relational models use SQL 

 $$\\[.1cm]$$
      
b. `DATA STORAGE AND DEFINITION` - a set of statements in a special type of DDL that is used to specify the storage structure an access method 
      - these statements define the schemas implementation and are hidden from users 
      - DDL also provides facalities to specify integrity constraints 

$$\\[.1cm]$$

c. Some Constraints:
      - Domain Constraints - limits an attribute to a domain of possible values it can take on 
      
            Ex. integer types, character types, date/time types 
      - Referential Integrity - ensuring that a value that occurs in one relation for a given set of attributes also appears in another set of attribute fro another relation 
      
            Ex. a department listed for a course must actually exist in the university 
      - Authorization -limits access among types of user 
            
            - Read authorization - can only read 
            - Insert authorization - insert new data but not change
            - Update authorization - allows modification but not deletions
            - Delete authorization - allows deletion 
            
            
:::note
User may have all, some, or none of these authorizations
:::


d. `DATA DICTIONARY` - the output of DDL statements that contaion metedata, or data about the data
      - can only be accessed and updated by the database system and not a regular user
      
e. `DATA-MANIPULATION LANGUAGE` - enables user to access or manipulate data accessed by the appropriate data model 
      - types of access are retrival, insertion, deletion, manipulation
      - 2 types of DML: _PROCEDURAL_ and _DECLARATIVE_
