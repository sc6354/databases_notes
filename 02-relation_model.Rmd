# Introduction to the Relational Model 
__The relational model is the primary model for commerical data processing applications.__

## Structure of the Relational Databases
a. A relational database consits of tables

b. generally, a row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values 

c. `RELATION` - a table 

d. `TUPLE` - a row 

e. `ATTRIBUTE` - a column in a table 

f. `RELATIONAL INSTANCE` - refers to a specific instance of a relation, or a specific set of rows 
      - ordered or unordered does __NOT__ matter as long as the same relations are in the set 
      
$$\\[.1cm]$$
g. `DOMAIN` - set of permitted values for an attribute of a relation 
            
      Ex. the domain of salary attribute of the instructor relation is the set of all possible salaries. 
       
h. `NULL VALUES` - signifies that a value is __UNKNOWN__ or does not exist 
      - best not to have null values as they will cause difficulties updating & accessing database 
      
## Database Schema 
a. `DATABASE SCHEMA` - the logical design of the database 
b. `DATABASE INSTANCE` - snapshot of the data in the database at a given time 

c. `RELATIONAL SCHEMA` - list of attributes & their corresponding domains 
      - relational instance - the value of a variable at a given time --> may change 
      - relational schema does not change 
      - relational instance and schema are often used interchageably
            
            
            Ex. instructor may mean instructor schema or instructor instance!!!

## Schema Diagrams 
a. `SCHEMA DIAGRAM` - depicts a database schema, all the keys, etc. 
      - relations are represented by __BOXES__ w/name on top and attributes listed inside the box 
      - primary keys are __UNDERLINED__ 
      - foreign key constraints are __ARROWS__ from foreign key attribute of referencing relation to the primary key of the referenced table 
      - referential integrity constraints are __TWO-HEADED ARROWS__

## Relational Query Language
a. `QUERY LANG.` - a language in which a user request info. from database 

b. `IMPERATIVE QUERY LANG.` - user instructs the system to perform a specific sequence of operations on the database to compute the desired results 

c. `FUNCTIONAL QUERY LANG.` - the computation is expressed as the evaluation of functions that may operate on the data or results of other functions

d. `DECLARATIVE QUERY LANG.` - user describes the desired info. w/o giving a specific instructions or function calls for obtaining the info. 
      - desired info. is usually expressed in some form of __mathematical logic__ 
      
:::note 
Usually query lang. such as SQL have elements of all 3 approaches.

## Relational Algebra 
a. `RELATIONAL ALGEBRA` - set of operations that take one or two relations as input & produce a new relation 
      - unary operations - operate on __ONE__ relation 
      
      
            Ex. select, project, & rename operations 
      
   - binary operations - operate on a pair of relations
    
      
            Ex. cartesian product, union, set-difference 
      
:::note 
Binary and unary operations can be combined in relational algebra expressions.

b. `SELECT` - choose rows that satisfy a given predicate 
      - denoted by $\sigma$ & predicate as a subscript to $\sigma$ 
      - relation is in parenthese after $\sigma$
      - Ex. $\sigma$~dept_name='physics'~ (instructors) selects rows of instructor table where instructor is in the Physics department
      - selection allows mathematical operators
      - Ex. $\sigma$~salary>90000~ (instructors) 
      - selction allow connectives (and, or, not)
      - selection allows comparison btw 2 attributes 
      - Ex. $\sigma$~dept_name='building'~ (instructors) finds all departments whose name is the same as their building  

$$\\[.1cm]$$

c. `PROJECT` - returns a table w/certain attributes left out 
      - denoted by $\Pi$
      - desired attributes are listed in __subscript__ 
      - table argument follows in __parenthese__ 
      - Ex. $\Pi$~ID,name,salary~ (instructors) 
      - project allows operations 
      - Ex. $\Pi$~ID,name,salary/12~ (instructors) returns monthly salary

$$\\[.1cm]$$

d. `CARTESIAN-PRODUCT` - combines info. from 2 tables 
      - denoted by __X__, a cross
      
$$\\[.1cm]$$

e. `UNION` - all rows that appear in either or both of 2 tables 
      - denoted by __U__, union symbol 
      - Ex. $\Pi$~course_ID~ ($\sigma$~semester='Fall'^year=2017~(Section)) __U__  $\Pi$~course_ID~ ($\sigma$~semester='Spring'^year=2018~(Section)) retunn all the courses taught in Fall 2017, Spring 2018, or both 

:::note 
For union to work:

1. both tables must have teh same arity (# of attributes)

2. if attributes have associated types, they must be the same for both tables

If 1 & 2 are satisfy, we call the tables __compatible relations__. 
:::
      
f. `INTERSECTION` - find rows in both tables

g. `SET-DIFFERENCES` - find rows in one table but are not in another 
      - denoted by __-__
      - Ex. $\Pi$~course_ID~ ($\sigma$~semester='Fall'^year=2017~(Section)) __-__  $\Pi$~course_ID~ ($\sigma$~semester='Spring'^year=2018~(Section)) finds all courses taught in Fall 2017 but not in Spring 2018

h. `ASSIGNMENT` - works like assignment in a programming lang. 
      - denoted by backward arrow, <-
      - evaluation of an assignment does __NOT__ result in any relation being displayed to the user 
      - instead the result is assigned to a table variable 
      - assignments are __TEMPORARY__; assignments to permanent tables is a database __MODIFICATION__
