Web-based services such as social media, online retailers, online advertisements Document-based for maintaining articles, patents, publications Navigation systems 1.2 Purpose of Database System FILE PROCESSING SYSTEM- is supported by a conventional operation system; stores permanent records in various files and needs different applications programs to extract records from, and add records to the appropriate files Many disadvantages of a file processing system: DATA REDUNDANCY AND INCONSISTENCY- due to different files with different structures and written in different languages by programmers over time DIFFICULTLY ACCESSING DATA - b/c conventional file-processing do NOT allow data to be retrieved in an efficient manner DATA ISOLATION - must write a new application program to retrieve data scattered in various formatted files INTEGRITY PROBLEMS - not being able to satisfy consistency constraints Ex. not being able to the program to enforce new constraints ATOMICITY PROBLEMS - changes must be atomic (it must happen in its entirety or not at all) Ex. a bank transfer from account A to B. A credit and a debit must occur, not just one CONCURRENT-ACCESS ANOMALITIES - when 2 user change the data and both changes are updated leading to 2 different results and supervision is DIFFICULT These difficulties prompted the transitions from file-based apps. to database systems in the 1960s and 1970s 1.3 View of Data major purpose of a database is to provide and ABSTRACT view of data while hiding the details of how data are stored and maintained DATA MODELS - the underlying structure of a database; a collection of conceptual tools, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints all data can be classified into 4 categories: RELATIONAL MODELS, ENTITY RELATIONAL MODEL, SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA MODEL, OBJECT-BASED MODEL \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] RELATIONAL MODEL- uses a colletion of tables to represent both the data and the relationships among those data Tables are also called relations and each table has multiple columns with unique names ENTITY-RELATIONAL (ER) MODEL - uses a collection of basic objects called ENTITIES and RELATIONSHIPS among those objects SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA MODEL - permits specification of data where individual data items of the same type may have different attributes data items in the models above must have the same set of attributes most widely used semi-structured data representations are JSON and extensible markup language (XML) \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] OBJECT-BASED DATA MODELS - extends the relational model w/notions of encapsulation, methods, and object identity DATA ABSTRACTION- hiding the complexity of the system from users to simplify their interaction w/the system 3 levels of abstractions: Levels of Abstraction - `VIEW LEVEL`- the highgest level of abstraction that only describes the part of the database; exist to simplify interaction w/the system and the system may provide multiple views for the same database - `LOGICAL LEVEL` - describes the entire databse in terms of a small number of relatively simple structures - `PHYSICAL LEVEL` - the lowest level of abstration that describes how the data is stored in detail Users at the logical level does not need to be aware of the complex physical structure involved (a.k.a physical data independence). Database adminstrators who decide on what info. to keep uses this level SCHEMA - the overall design of the database physical schema -&gt; the design at the physical level logical schema -&gt; the design at the logical level subschema -&gt; the design at the view level logical schema most important b/c programmers use this schema to construct applications applications exhibit PHYSICAL DATA INDEPENDENCE if they do not depend on the physical schema 1.4 Database Languages a DBMS provides a data-definition language (DDL) to specify the database schema and a data-manipulation language (DML) to express database queries and update in practice DDL and DML are parts of a single database language such as SQL and almost all relational models use SQL \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] DATA STORAGE AND DEFINITION - a set of statements in a special type of DDL that is used to specify the storage structure an access method these statements define the schemas implementation and are hidden from users DDL also provides facalities to specify integrity constraints \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Some Constraints: Domain Constraints - limits an attribute to a domain of possible values it can take on Ex. integer types, character types, date/time types Referential Integrity - ensuring that a value that occurs in one relation for a given set of attributes also appears in another set of attribute fro another relation Ex. a department listed for a course must actually exist in the university Authorization -limits access among types of user - Read authorization - can only read - Insert authorization - insert new data but not change - Update authorization - allows modification but not deletions - Delete authorization - allows deletion User may have all, some, or none of these authorizations DATA DICTIONARY - the output of DDL statements that contaion metedata, or data about the data can only be accessed and updated by the database system and not a regular user \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] DATA-MANIPULATION LANGUAGE - enables user to access or manipulate data accessed by the appropriate data model types of access are retrival, insertion, deletion, manipulation 2 types of DML: PROCEDURAL and DECLARATIVE \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] PROCEDURAL DMLs- user must specify what data to get and how to get it DECLARATIVE (NONPROCEDURAL) - user must specify what data to get but not how the database system will fiqure out an efficient way of retrieving the data \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] QUERY - statement requesting retrival of info. and query language is the part of the DML that involves this info. retrieval technically incorrect, but DML and queary lang. is often used interchangeably most common query language is SQL (a nonprocedural lang.) \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] APPLICATION PROGRAMS - programs that use a host lang. such as C/C++, Java, or Python with embedded SQL queries to interact w/ the database Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standards define interfaces for C and other languages Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) standards define interface fro Java lang. 1.5 Database Design Mainly involves the design of the database schema Conceptual Design - provides a detailed overview of the enterprise confirms all requirements are met and are not in conflict w/each other Normalization - one of the 2 main ways on how to group attributes from various tables - normaliztion employs a set of algorithms that takes as inputs the set of all attributes and generates a set of table - the other way is to use the Entity Relational Model SPECIFICATION OF FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS - describes the kind of operations that will be performed on the data \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] LOGICAL DESIGN PHASE - the designer maps the high level conceptual schema onto the implementation data model of the database system that will be used PHYSICAL DESIGN PHASE - where physical feature of the database are specified 1.6 Database Engine a database system is divided into modules that deal w/a part of the system Functional components of the system can be divided into the storage manager, the quesry processor, and transcation management STORAGE MANAGER - storing, retrieving, &amp; updating data in the database includes the authorization and integrity manager, transaction manager, file manager, and buffer manager also implements several data structures as part of the physical system implementation: data files, data dictionary, indices \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] QUERY PROCESSOR - includes DDL interpreter, DML compiler, and query evaluation engine compiler translate queries into an evalution plan of low-level instructions that can be understood by the evaluation engine compiler also performs QUERY OPTIMIZATION to pick the lowest cost evaluation plan TRANSACTION MANAGER- consist of the concurrency-control manager and the recovery manager concurrency-control manager ensures consistency of the database recovery manager ensures durability and atomicity of the database system itself &amp; can perform failure recovery to restore database to state prior to crash/failure 1.7 Database &amp; Application Architecture Applications that use databases as their backend can be partitioned into 2 or 3 tier parts 2-TIER APPLICATIONS - application resides at the client machine, and invokes database system fuctionality at the server machine via query lang. statements usually in older applications 3-TIER ARCHITECTURE - client machine acts as front end and does not contain any direct database calls; instead front end communicates with an application server and server than communicates with the database system to access data web browsers and mobile apps are the most commonly used application clients better security and performance than 2-tier 2 tier vs 3 tier 1.8 Database Users and Administrators Users are defined by the way they are expected to interact w/the system DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR (DBA) - the person who has central control over the system and performs: schema definitions storage structure and access method definition schema &amp; physical-organizational modification granting of authorization for data access routine maintenance "],["introduction-to-the-relational-model.html", "2 Introduction to the Relational Model 2.1 Structure of the Relational Databases 2.2 Database Schema 2.3 EXCLUDED 2.4 Schema Diagrams 2.5 Relational Query Language 2.6 Relational Algebra", " 2 Introduction to the Relational Model The relational model is the primary model for commerical data processing applications. 2.1 Structure of the Relational Databases A relational database consits of tables generally, a row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values RELATION - a table TUPLE - a row ATTRIBUTE - a column in a table RELATIONAL INSTANCE - refers to a specific instance of a relation, or a specific set of rows ordered or unordered does NOT matter as long as the same relations are in the set \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] g. DOMAIN - set of permitted values for an attribute of a relation Ex. the domain of salary attribute of the instructor relation is the set of all possible salaries. NULL VALUES - signifies that a value is UNKNOWN or does not exist best not to have null values as they will cause difficulties updating &amp; accessing database 2.2 Database Schema DATABASE SCHEMA - the logical design of the database DATABASE INSTANCE - snapshot of the data in the database at a given time RELATIONAL SCHEMA - list of attributes &amp; their corresponding domains relational instance - the value of a variable at a given time –&gt; may change relational schema does not change relational instance and schema are often used interchageably Ex. instructor may mean instructor schema or instructor instance!!! 2.3 EXCLUDED 2.4 Schema Diagrams SCHEMA DIAGRAM - depicts a database schema, all the keys, etc. relations are represented by BOXES w/name on top and attributes listed inside the box primary keys are UNDERLINED foreign key constraints are ARROWS from foreign key attribute of referencing relation to the primary key of the referenced table referential integrity constraints are TWO-HEADED ARROWS Example of a Schema Diagram 2.5 Relational Query Language QUERY LANG. - a language in which a user request info. from database IMPERATIVE QUERY LANG. - user instructs the system to perform a specific sequence of operations on the database to compute the desired results FUNCTIONAL QUERY LANG. - the computation is expressed as the evaluation of functions that may operate on the data or results of other functions DECLARATIVE QUERY LANG. - user describes the desired info. w/o giving a specific instructions or function calls for obtaining the info. desired info. is usually expressed in some form of mathematical logic Usually query lang. such as SQL have elements of all 3 approaches. 2.6 Relational Algebra RELATIONAL ALGEBRA - set of operations that take one or two relations as input &amp; produce a new relation unary operations - operate on ONE relation Ex. select, project, &amp; rename operations binary operations - operate on a pair of relations Ex. cartesian product, union, set-difference Binary and unary operations can be combined in relational algebra expressions. \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] SELECT - choose rows that satisfy a given predicate denoted by \\(\\sigma\\) &amp; predicate as a subscript to \\(\\sigma\\) relation is in parenthese after \\(\\sigma\\) Ex. \\(\\sigma\\)dept_name=‘physics’ (instructors) selects rows of instructor table where instructor is in the Physics department selection allows mathematical operators Ex. \\(\\sigma\\)salary&gt;90000 (instructors) selction allow connectives (and, or, not) selection allows comparison btw 2 attributes Ex. \\(\\sigma\\)dept_name=‘building’ (instructors) finds all departments whose name is the same as their building \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] PROJECT - returns a table w/certain attributes left out denoted by \\(\\Pi\\) desired attributes are listed in subscript table argument follows in parenthese Ex. \\(\\Pi\\)ID,name,salary (instructors) project allows operations Ex. \\(\\Pi\\)ID,name,salary/12 (instructors) returns monthly salary \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] CARTESIAN-PRODUCT - combines info. from 2 tables denoted by X, a cross \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] UNION - all rows that appear in either or both of 2 tables denoted by U, union symbol Ex. \\(\\Pi\\)course_ID (\\(\\sigma\\)semester=‘Fall’^year=2017(Section)) U \\(\\Pi\\)course_ID (\\(\\sigma\\)semester=‘Spring’^year=2018(Section)) retunn all the courses taught in Fall 2017, Spring 2018, or both For union to work: both tables must have teh same arity (# of attributes) if attributes have associated types, they must be the same for both tables If 1 &amp; 2 are satisfy, we call the tables compatible relations. INTERSECTION - find rows in both tables SET-DIFFERENCES - find rows in one table but are not in another denoted by - Ex. \\(\\Pi\\)course_ID (\\(\\sigma\\)semester=‘Fall’^year=2017(Section)) - \\(\\Pi\\)course_ID (\\(\\sigma\\)semester=‘Spring’^year=2018(Section)) finds all courses taught in Fall 2017 but not in Spring 2018 \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] ASSIGNMENT - works like assignment in a programming lang. denoted by backward arrow, &lt;- evaluation of an assignment does NOT result in any relation being displayed to the user instead the result is assigned to a table variable assignments are TEMPORARY; assignments to permanent tables is a database MODIFICATION Only the final line displays the result.

Thus a comparision of A (char type) = A (varchar type) may return false, so ALWAYS use varchar. \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] create table - command to create a relation general form is where r = name of table, Ai = attribute, &amp; Di = domain of attribute, type of attribute, &amp; constraints \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Query Examples \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] drop table r - deletes all info. about table r and removes it from the database delete from r - deletes all the rows in table r but does NOT delete it from the database alter table r add A D - adds atribute A of type D to an existing table r &amp; assigns it null values (the default) alter table r drop A - drop attribute A from table r many database systems do NOT allow attributes to be dropped despite allowing tables to be dropped 3.3 Basic structure of SQL queries Basic structure consists of 3 clauses SELECT, FROM, $ WHERE SELECT allows duplicates in results use SELECT DISTINCT to remove duplicates use SELECT ALL to explicitly specify duplicates are NOT removed SELECT also allows arthmetic expressions w/+, -, *, &amp; / \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] WHERE - specify the requirement/predicate involving attributes allows logical connectiveness AND, OR, &amp; NOT operands can be expressions w/comparsion operators &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, =, &amp; &lt;&gt; \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] General meaning of a SQL query: generate a cartesian product of the tables listed in the FROM clause apply the predicates specified in the WHERE clause on the result of step 1 for each row in the result of step 2, output the attributes specified in the SELECT clause This is NOT how SQL queries are executed. A real implementation would only generate elements of the cartesion product that satisfy the where clause predicates. 3.4 Additional Basic Operations as clause - used to rename the attributes of a resulting relation can be used w/select &amp; from clause \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] correlation name - an identifier that is used to rename a relation a.k.a table alias, correlation variable, tuple variable \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] String Operators: upper(s) - makes string ‘s’ all uppercase lower(s) - converts string ‘s’ to all lowercase trim(s) - removes the space at the end like - operator used for pattern matching \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] LIKE - used to express patterns there are 2 special characters for describing patterns: % and _ % matches any substring _ matches any character patterns are case SENSITIVE ‘Intro%’ matches any string beginning w/“Intro” ‘%Comp%’ mathches any string containing “Comp” as a substring ’___’ mathces any string w/exactly 3 characters ’___%’ - matches any string of at least 3 characters Ex. &quot;Find all the names of all departments whose building names includes the substring &#39;Watons&#39;. SELECT dept_name FROM department WHERE building LIKE &#39;%Watson%&#39; \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] escape keyword - used immediately before % and _ to indicate that it is to be treated like a normal character Ex. 1. LIKE &#39;ab\\%cd%&#39;escape&#39;\\&#39; matches all strings beginning w/&quot;ab%cd&quot; 2. LIKE &#39;ab\\\\cd%&#39;escape&#39;\\&#39; matches all strings beginning w/&quot;ab\\cd&quot; NOT LIKE - used to search for mismatches * (asterisk) - used w/select clause to mean all attributes ORDER BY - causes the tuples in the result of a query to appear in a sorted order default is in ascending order so use desc for descending order can be used on multiple attributes Ex. SELECT * FROM instructor ORDER BY salary desc, name asc; \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] BETWEEN - a comparison operator to simplify the where clause that specify that value is less than or equal to a value and greater than or equal to some value Ex. Write this: SELECT name FROM instructor WHERE salary BETWEEN 90000 and 100000; Instead of this: SELECT name FROM instructor WHERE salary &lt;= 100000 AND salary &gt;= 90000; \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] ROW CONSTRUCTOR - allows comparison operators to be used on tuples; (\\(a\\)1, \\(a\\)2) &lt;= (\\(b\\)1, \\(b\\)2) is true if \\(a\\)1 &lt;= \\(b\\)1 &amp; \\(a\\)2 &lt;= \\(b\\)2 Ex. Write this: SELECT name, course_id FROM instructor, teaches WHERE (instructor.ID, dept_name) = (teaches.ID, &#39;Biology&#39;); Instead of this: SELECT name, course_id FROM instructor, teaches WHERE instructor.ID = teaches.ID and dept_name = &#39;Biology&#39;; 3.5 Set Operations union - automatically remove duplicates use UNION ALL to retain all duplicates \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] intersect - tuple in common btw 2 tables; automatically remove duplicates use INTERSECT ALL to retain all duplicates note that INTERSECT ALL returns the minimum number of duplicates in the 2 tables Ex. So if 4 sections of ICP 101 were taught in Fall 2017 and 2 sections taught in Spring 2018, then there would be 2 tuples with ICP 101 in the resulting table \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] except - outputs all tuples from the first table that is not in the second table; perfroms set difference use EXCEPT ALL to retain duplicates EXCEPT ALL returns the number of duplicates in table 1 minus the number of duplicates in table 2 if the difference is POSITIVE. 3.6 Null Values NULL VALUES - presents problems for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and set operations the result of any arithmetic expressions (+, -, *, or /) is null if any of the input values is null the result of any comparison w/null values is unknown boolean operators are extended to deal w/unknowns and: result of true and unknown is unknown false and unknown is false unknown and unknown is unknown or: true or unknown is true false or unknown is unknown unknown or unknown is unknown not: result of not unknown is unknown \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] null - a special keyword that can be used in the where clause to test for null values Ex. WHERE salary is null Alternatively, WHERE salary is not null -&gt; will select not null values \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] is unknown - another special keyword to test whether the result of a comparison is unknown Ex. WHERE salary &gt; 100000 is unknown Alternatively, WHERE salary &gt; 100000 is not unknown unknown &amp; not unknown are not supported by several databases 3.7 Aggregate Functions aggregate functions take a collection of (a set or multiset) of values as input &amp; returns a single value SQL offers 5 standard built-in functions avg -&gt; average min -&gt; minimum max -&gt; maximum sum -&gt; total count -&gt; count sum &amp; avg must have numeric inputs, other functions can operate on nonnumeric datatypes \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] GROUP BY - forms groups using specified attribute(s) Ex. SELECT dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary FROM instructors GROUP BY dept_name; \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] HAVING clause - applies conditions to each group rather than on a single row Ex. SELECT dept_name, avg(salary) as avg_salary FROM instructors GROUP BY dept_name HAVING avg(salary) &gt; 42000; sequence of operations for queries w/group by &amp; having clauses: FROM is evaluated first if present, WHERE is applied on the resulting table of the from clause rows satisfying the WHERE clause are placed into groups in the GROUP BY clause if present, HAVING clause is applied to each group &amp; groups that do not satisfy the HAVING clause are removed SELECT generates a single tuple for each group by applying the aggregate function all aggregate functions except count(*) ignore null in their inputs the count of an empty set is 0, while the result of other functions is null 3.8 Nested Subqueries subquery - a SELECT-FROM-WHERE expression that is nested within another query correlated subquery - a subquery that uses a correlation name from an outer query 3.9 Modification of the Databases DELETE - used to remove whole tuples only DELETE cannot remove attributes, must be the entire row General form: DELETE FROM r WHERE p; p is the predicate &amp; r is the relation DELETE first finds all tuples, t in r for which p(t) is true and then deletes it from r WHERE can be omitted, in which all rows in r are deleted DELETE can only operate on one relation if all rows are deleted, the table still exists but is EMPTY \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] INSERT - allows us to add a single tuple or a set of tuples into a relation tuples inserted must have the correct num. of attributes \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] UPDATE - can change a value in a tuple w/o changing all values \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] CASE - allows us to perform multiple updates in a single UPDATE statement, thereby avoiding the problem w/the order of tuples Ex. general form: UPDATE table SET attribute = CASE WHEN pred1 then result1 WHEN pred2 then result2 ... WHEN predN then resultN else result0 end "],["intermediate-sql.html", "4 Intermediate SQL 4.1 Example one 4.2 Example two", " 4 Intermediate SQL Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 4.1 Example one 4.2 Example two "],["advanced-sql.html", "5 Advanced SQL 5.1 Accessing SQL from a Programming Language 5.2 Functions and Procedures 5.3 Triggers 5.4 Recursive Queries", " 5 Advanced SQL 5.1 Accessing SQL from a Programming Language Database programmer must have access to a general programming language b/c… NOT all queries can be expressed in SQL Nondeclarative actions such as printing a report, or sending the results of a query to a graphical user interface; querying data is just one of the many components of an App. \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] There are 2 general approaches to accessing SQL through a general programming language: Dynamic SQL or Embbedded SQL DYNAMIC SQL - allows general purpose programs to connect and communicate w/a database server using a colleciton of functions and methods JDBC - appplication program interface for Java ODBC - for C language, C++, C#, Ruby, Go, PHP, Visual Basic Python Database API - for Python \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] EMBEDDED SQL - allows functions calls to connect to database using an API w/dynamic SQL facilities at runtime JDBC - defines the API that Java programs use to connect to database servers orginally an abbreviation for Java Database Connectivity but full form is no longer used \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Connecting to a Database in JDBC: Select which database to use; can be an instance of Oracle running on local machine or PostgreSQL running on another machine Open a connection to the database using getConnection() getConnection() takes 3 parameters: URL/machine name of server, user identifier, and password Before opening a connection, the JDBC driver must be dynamically loaded first w/specified protocol like ‘jdbc:oracle:thin:’ or ‘jdbc:mysql:’ Sending SQL statements to Database System in JDBC: the Statement class allows the programs to send SQL statements to the database system for execution a Statement object is NOT the SQL statement itself but rather an object that invokes methods that take in SQL statements as arguments and sends them to the database systems use excuteQuery() method for query statements use executeUpdate() method for nonquery statements (UPDATE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT, DELETE) \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] g. Handling Exceptions in JDBC: - executing SQL methods can result in an exception - the try {…} catch {…} construct can catch any JDBC errors - SQLexception - SQL-specific exception - Exception - regular Java errors \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] prepareStatement() - method that allows us to predefine a query statement w/“?” as placeholders for actual values to provided by user always use prepared statements when taking an input from the user &amp; adding it to a query NEVER create a query by concetanating strings of user entered inputs b/c if user enters certain special characters such as a single quote, the resulting SQL query my be syntactically incorrect luckily, setString() method checks for this &amp; inserts necessary escape characters to ensure syntactic correctness \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] SQL INJECTION - a code injection technique that might destroy your database one of the most common web hacking techniques the placement of malicious code in SQL statements via web place entered inputs Injection based on 1=1 is always TRUE Ex. userID: 105 or 1=1 Corresponding SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE userID=105 OR 1=1 the sql is valid and will return all rows from the User Table since 1=1 is always True Injection based on \"“=”\" is always True Ex. username: &quot; or &quot;&quot;=&quot; password: &quot; or &quot;&quot;=&quot; SQL: SELECT * FROM users WHERE Name=&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot; AND pass=&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;=&quot;&quot; the sql is valid and will return all rows from the User Table b/c “‘=’” is always True injection based on Batched SQL statements (group of 2 or more SQL statements seperated by semicolon) Ex. userId: 105; DROP TABLE suppliers SQL: SELECT userID FROM User where userId =105; DROP TABLE suppliers \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] METADATA FEATURES - Java App does not have declarations for data stored in database &amp; must either have it hard-coded or determine the info. directly at runtime when an executeQuery() method is executed, it returns a result set object, which contain the method getMetadata() getMetadata() returns ResultSetMetaData object w/methods to find Metadata info. getColumnCount() returns arity of the result relation getColumnName() returns names of the column getColumnTypeName() returns data types of columns getColumns() returns info. about columns getTable() returns list of all tables in database getPrimaryKeys() getCrossReferences returns foreign keys \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] k. Handling Large Object Types: getBlob() &amp; getClob() are similiar to getString(), but returns objects of type Blob &amp; Clob that stores locators for large objects or logical pointers to the actual object in the database getBytes() or getSubstring() fetches data from these objects to update large objects, link an input stream to a Blob or Clob object like this… blob.set(int parameterIndex, Input stream inputStream); \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] OPEN DATABASE CONNECTIVITY (ODBC) - defines an API that apps can use to open a connection w/a database, send queries, &amp; update and get back results apps such as GUI, spreadsheets, statistic packages can use ODBC \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] m. EMBEDDED SQL- defines the embeddings of SQL in variety of programming languages host language - the language to which SQL queries are embedded embbedded SQL - the SQL structures permitted in the host lang. EXEC SQL is used in host lang. to identify embedded SQL requests to the preprocessor Ex. general form: EXEC SQL &lt; embedded SQL &gt;; COBOL: semeicolon is replaced by END-EXEC Java: embeddings use #SQL {....}; Apps must connect to database before executing any SQL statements Ex. EXEC-SQL connect to server user username using password; Variables of host lang. can be used inside embedded SQL; they are preceded by a colon (:) &amp; must be delcared within the DECLARE section Ex. :credit_amount to write an embedded SQL query, use ’declare c cursor for where c identifies the query Ex. EXEC SQL declare c cursor for SELECT ID, name FROM student WHERE tot_cred &gt; :credit_amount END_EXEC To actual execute the above query and save the results within a temporary relation, we must “open” it using EXEC-SQL open c; \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] use a fetch statement to save one row of query results to host lang. variable. Ex. EXEC-SQL fetch c into :si, :sn END_EXEC use close statement to delete temporary relation that holds the query results Ex. EXEC SQL close c; 5.2 Functions and Procedures functions &amp; procedures allow business logic to be stored in the database &amp; executed from SQL statements they can be defined either by procedural SQL or by an external programming lang. SQL syntax for implementation varies across databases \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] FUNCTIONS - -Ex. Function that returns count of instructors in a department. CREATE Function dept_count(dept_name varchar(20)) returns integer begin declare d_count integer SELECT COUNT(*) into d_count FROM instructor WHERE instructor.dept_name = dept_name return d_count; End -Usage: SELECT dept_name, budget FROM department WHERE dept_count(dept_name) &gt;12 \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] TABLE FUNCTIONS - functions that return tables as results - Ex CREATE function instructor_of(dept_name char(20)) returns table( ID varchar(5), name varchar(20), dept_name varchar(20), salary numeric (8,2)) return table (SELECT ID, name, dept_name, salary FROM instructor WHERE instructor.dept_name = instructor_of.dept_name) -Usage SELECT * FROM table (instructor_of(&#39;Music&#39;)) Returns all instructors in the music department. For a simple query like this, we probably don’t need a function. Just write a query \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] PARAMETERIZED VIEWS - generalized views created by table-valued functions &amp; their parameters PROCEDURES - often referred to as stored procedures; is a reusable unit of SQL statements &amp; logic, compiled &amp; stored together to perfom a specific task Ex. CREATE procedure dept_count_pro (IN dept_name varchar(20), OUT d_count integer) begin SELECT COUNT(*) into d_count FROM instructor WHERE instructor.dept_name = dept_count_proc.dept_name end \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Procedures can be invoked either from an SQL procedure or embedded SQL via a ‘cal’ statement Ex. Declare d_count integer, call dept_count_proc(&#39;Physic&#39;, d_count); Functions &amp; Procedures can have the same name as other functions and procedures as long as the number of arguments are different or at least one argument is different \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] PERSISTENT STORAGE MODULE (PSM)- gives SQL almost all the power of a general programming lang. 5.3 Triggers TRIGGERS - a statement that the system executes automatically as a side effect of a modification to the database to define a trigger, we must specify the conditions under which a trigger is to be executed specify the actions to be taken when the trigger is called \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Triggers can be activated before an event (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) Statement-level triggers use ‘for each statement’ instead of ‘for each row’ when executing a single action for all rows affected by the transaction use ‘referencing old table’ or ‘referencing new table’ to refer to temporary tables w/affected rows \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Triggers can be disable or enabled; default is enabled upon creation Triggers can be dropped, which removes it permanently Triggers were used earlier for tasks such as Maintaining summary data (e.g., total salary of each department) Replicating databases by recording changes to special relations (called change or delta relations) and having a separate process that applies the changes over to a replica \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] There are better ways of doing these now: Databases today provide built in materialized view facilities to maintain summary data Databases provide built-in support for replication \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Encapsulation facilities can be used instead of triggers in many cases Define methods to update fields Carry out actions as part of the update methods instead of through a trigger \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Risk of unintended execution of triggers, for example, when Loading data from a backup copy Replicating updates at a remote site Trigger execution can be disabled before such actions. \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] Other risks with triggers: Error leading to failure of critical transactions that set off the trigger Cascading execution 5.4 Recursive Queries Any recursive view must be a union of 2 subqueries: a base query that is NOT recursive &amp; a recursive query that uses a recursive view FIXED POINT - of the recursive view is the resultant view where not more new tuples are added Recursive views make it possible to write queries, such as transitive closure queries, that cannot be written without recursion or iteration.
