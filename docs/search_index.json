Web-based services such as social media, online retailers, online advertisements Document-based for maintaining articles, patents, publications Navigation systems 1.2 Purpose of Database System FILE PROCESSING SYSTEM- is supported by a conventional operation system; stores permanent records in various files and needs different applications programs to extract records from, and add records to the appropriate files Many disadvantages of a file processing system: DATA REDUNDANCY AND INCONSISTENCY- due to different files with different structures and written in different languages by programmers over time DIFFICULTLY ACCESSING DATA - b/c conventional file-processing do NOT allow data to be retrieved in an efficient manner DATA ISOLATION - must write a new application program to retrieve data scattered in various formatted files INTEGRITY PROBLEMS - not being able to satisfy consistency constraints Ex. not being able to the program to enforce new constraints ATOMICITY PROBLEMS - changes must be atomic (it must happen in its entirety or not at all) Ex. a bank transfer from account A to B. A credit and a debit must occur, not just one CONCURRENT-ACCESS ANOMALITIES - when 2 user change the data and both changes are updated leading to 2 different results and supervision is DIFFICULT These difficulties prompted the transitions from file-based apps. to database systems in the 1960s and 1970s 1.3 View of Data major purpose of a database is to provide and ABSTRACT view of data while hiding the details of how data are stored and maintained DATA MODELS - the underlying structure of a database; a collection of conceptual tools, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints all data can be classified into 4 categories: RELATIONAL MODELS, ENTITY RELATIONAL MODEL, SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA MODEL, OBJECT-BASED MODEL \\[\\\\[.1cm]\\] RELATIONAL MODEL- uses a colletion of tables to represent both the data and the relationships among those data Tables are also called relations and each table has multiple columns with unique names ENTITY-RELATIONAL (ER) MODEL - uses a collection of basic objects called ENTITIES and RELATIONSHIPS among those objects SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA MODEL - permits specification of data where individual data items of the same type may have different attributes data items in the models above must have the same set of attributes most widely used semi-structured data representations are JSON and extensible markup language (XML) "]
