# Application Development 

## Application Programs & User Interfaces

a. Client-server-architecture - a personal directory communicates w/a shared databases
      - two big drawbacks:
            
            1. Security risks b/c user machines had direct access to database 
            2. any changes/updates to app/database required all copies of the app to be updated

 b. 2 approaches to avoid client-server architecture problems:
      - web browsers
      - application programs installed on individual (usual mobile) devices
      
## Web Fundamentals 
a.   `WEB BROWSERS` = de facto standard user interface to database b/c...
      - they allow large num. of users to access database anywhere 
      - avoid the need to download/install specialized code while also providing a good GUI

b. HTTP protocol is connectionless 
      -  connectionless means that once the server replies to a request, the server closes the connection w/the client and forgets all about the requests
      - in contrast, Unix logins and JDBC/ODBC connections stay connected until the client disconnects; this retains user authentication & other info. 
      - connectionless reduces load on server since operating systems have tight limits on num. of open connections on a machine

c. Info. services like user authentication needs session info. 
      - authentication should be done only once per session 
      - the solution is to use a cookie 
$$\\[.1cm]$$

d. `COOKIE` - a small piece of text containing identifying info. 
      - sent by server to browser on first interaction to identify session 
      - the text is part of the HTTP protocol that creates the cookie on further interactions 
      - server saves info. about the cookie it issued, & uses it when serving a request like authentication info and displaying user preferences from same machine

e. Cookies can be stored permanently or for a limited time
